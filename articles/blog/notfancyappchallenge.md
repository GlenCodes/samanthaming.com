# Introducing the #NotFancyAppChallenge

I don‚Äôt know about you but I always get stressed about making the perfect app. And what always ends up happening is that I never get it done. So I created this challenge! Build an app within 24 hours üëè I think having a time constraint will force us to actually complete something. The best way to master something is through practice. Quantity will lead to Quality. By building a lot of small simple projects, we can all become better developers!

## Join the Challenge üíª

This challenge is all about learning by doing. The only rule, it must be completed within 24 hours. Anything more, it‚Äôs too fancy üòú.

## Tips for the Challenge ‚≠êÔ∏è

Keep it super simple. One feature at most. Otherwise, you will run out of time if you plan too many features. Remember this not suppose to be fancy, so don‚Äôt worry about making it perfect. Just get something done ‚úåÔ∏è

## Submitting your Challenge üí™

You can submit your completed [NotFancyAppChallenge](https://github.com/samanthaming/awesome-notfancyappchallenge) to our Awesome list on GitHub. You can also browse through the list for inspirations. My challenges always include some general steps to recreate the app. So feel free to build your version of my challenges.

## My Approach to the Challenge üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The first step is to find an app idea. I‚Äôve been doing [Wes Bos](undefined) [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) course, so I have a lot of inspirations to pull from. But there also a lot of other sites that have really good project ideas:

- [https://learn.freecodecamp.org/](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)
- [https://javascript30.com/](https://javascript30.com/)
- [https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-project-ideas/](https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-project-ideas/)

My break down is typically 40‚Äì60. 40% of my time is spent writing the HTML and JavaScript. 60% is the CSS. Surprisingly, the design always takes me the longest time. The challenge takes me anywhere from 2 hours to 6 hours to complete. Of course, the time variation depends on the complexity and my familiarity with the feature I‚Äôm trying to build. A lot of the time can be spent on research and reading about the topic. For me, I do include that time as part of the challenge. Overall I really enjoy this challenge. I‚Äôve learned a lot and build things that I would never do at work. So I really feel, my development skills have improved or at least I feel more confident about it!

I hope you will give this challenge a try. At least try to build ONE challenge. Nothing to lose and everything to gain üòÅ

I can‚Äôt wait to see what you‚Äôll build! Good luck and Happy Programming!
