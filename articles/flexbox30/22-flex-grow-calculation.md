# Day 22: flex-grow calculation

Being able to grow and fill the free space is pretty cool. Because we don't set the final width of our flex item, the size it grows to always seem so random to me. So let's look at the math. Honestly you don't need to know this to understand Flexbox. The browser takes care of this automatically for you. But knowing what's behind this sorcery might demystify this process and help you understand it better. It's like once you know the trick to the magic, you're no longer tricked by the magic üòâ

## Calculation

I know it can be quite overwhelming to see all numbers crammed into a tidbit. So let's walk through the calculation üëç

Here's the `HTML` and `CSS` we're working with:

_HTML_

```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child green"></div>
  <div class="child yellow"></div>
  <div class="child blue"></div>
</div>
```

_CSS_

```css
.parent {
  width: 700px;
}
.child {
  width: 100px;
}
.green {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
.yellow {
  flex-grow: 0;
}
.blue {
  flex-grow: 3;
}
```

### Step 1: Breaking down the variables

Here's the formula:

```code
new width = ( (flex grow / total flex grow) x free space) + width
```

Let's extract the variables required in the formula to this handy table we can fill in as we go:

| Variables  |                     |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| flex grow  | _provided from css_ |
| total flex | _need to calculate_ |
| free space | _need to calculate_ |
| width      | _provided from css_ |

### Step 2: Fill in what we know

From the `CSS` value, we can conclude the following:

- Each child element has a width `100`
- The parent element (container) has a width of `700`
- The child has a `flex-grow` of `1`, `0`, `3`

Let's update our chart with this information:

|            | Green | Yellow | Blue |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ | ---- |
| flex grow  | 1     | 0      | 3    |
| total flex |
| free space |
| width      | 100   | 100    | 100  |

### Step 3: Calculate "free space"

This is the formula:

```code
free space = parent width - total children widths
```

Remember what we know:

- Each child element has a width `100`
- The parent element (container) has a width of `700`

Great, we can use that information to calculate "total children widths":

```code
total children widths = green + yellow + blue
                      = 100   + 100    + 100

=> 300
```

Now we can calculate our "free space":

```code
free space = parent width - total children widths
           = 700          -  300

=> 400
```

Let's update our chart and add these additional information:

|            | Green | Yellow | Blue | Total   |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ------- |
| flex grow  | 1     | 0      | 3    |
| total flex |
| free space | -     | -      | -    | **400** |
| width      | 100   | 100    | 100  |

### Step 4: Calculate "total flex grow"

This is an easy one, we simply add up our total `flex-grow`:

```code
total flex grow = green + yellow + blue
                = 1     + 0      + 3

=> 4
```

Fill in our chart and Voil√†! We have all the information we need for the final calculation üëç

|            | Green | Yellow | Blue | Total |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| flex grow  | 1     | 0      | 3    | **4** |
| free space | -     | -      | -    | 400   |
| width      | 100   | 100    | 100  |

### Final step: Calculate "new width"

Remember the formula:

```code
new width = ( (flex grow / total flex grow) x free space) + width
```

_a. Green_

```code
new width = ( (1/4 * 400) ) + 100

=> 200
```

_b. Yellow_

```code
new width = ( (0/4 * 400) ) + 100

=> 100
```

_c. Blue_

```code
new width = ( (3/4 * 400) ) + 100

=> 400
```

Done! We have successfully calculated the new width ü•≥

|               | Green   | Yellow  | Blue    | Total |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- |
| width         | 100     | 100     | 100     |
| flex grow     | 1       | 0       | 3       | 4     |
| free space    |         |         |         | 400   |
| **new width** | **200** | **100** | **400** |
